#### Switzerland
One of my Favourite destination is Switzerland, but also very attractive to the __travelers and tourists__. This is why Switzerland is a great place for travelling. Culture Switzerland is a nation of full of traditions. There are over 100 fun and enjoyable holidays and festivals through out the year for celebrating **foods, religions, and fall harvest**.
